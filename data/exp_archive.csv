(smith, as he was eager to acknowledge, was supported in the film by saniyya sidney as venus, demi singleton as serena and aunjanue ellis as the girls’ mother and williams’s wife at the time, oracene price.) richard williams, as embodied by smith, is a man who has been physically bowed but not beaten. he has a limp from a racist attack as a child; his carriage is tense, a little unsure, as if always on alert for a sucker punch. he’s someone who has spent time beneath the underdog. and yet when it comes to williams’s daughters and his dreams for them of tennis greatness, smith invests his character with his trademark on-screen self-assurance. that smith, who is 53 and who this autumn published a searching memoir, “will,” was able to express those disparate traits so effectively is something he attributes to the work, precipitated by that book, that he has lately put into himself. “i wouldn’t have been able to play richard williams in this way,” smith says, “before i had examined my life and understood so many aspects of my childhood and how that affected the decisions i made as a parent.”",1530
